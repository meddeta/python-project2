Fare Calculator and Miscellaneous Tasks
Project Overview
This Python project encompasses a series of interactive tasks that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as input handling, loops, conditionals, and string manipulation. The project is divided into four distinct tasks:

Compute Fare: Calculates the fare for a trip based on trip type and age group.
String Manipulation: Performs operations on a user-entered string, including character iteration and reversal.
Maximum Even Number Finder: Finds the largest even number from a user-entered series of positive integers.
Better Triangle Drawing: Draws a symmetrical triangle based on user input for its size.
Installation
No additional libraries are required for this project. It runs with standard Python 3.x. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Usage
Each task is executed sequentially. Follow the prompts on the console to input data for each task.

Task 1: Compute Fare
The user is prompted to choose between a one-way or round-trip.
Next, the user selects an age range from three options.
The program calculates the fare based on these inputs.
Task 2: String Manipulation
The user inputs a string.
The program iterates through the string, replacing spaces with the word "SPACE" and prints each character.
It then prints the string in reverse, omitting spaces.
Task 3: Maximum Even Number Finder
The user is prompted to enter a series of positive integers.
To stop entering numbers, the user inputs a negative integer.
The program finds and prints the largest even number from the entered series.
Task 4: Better Triangle Drawing
The user enters a number between 5 and 20 to set the triangle's size.
The program prints a symmetric triangle based on the entered size.
